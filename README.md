ROS2 workspace files from ROBO24 robot Pi4 SDCard

My other repositories are required for the complete project:

Arduino - This code repository has code for each of the microcontrollers which connecct using USB serial to ROS2 topics

[micropython-stuff-jon](https://github.com/mikew123/micropython-stuff-jon) - This code repository is for the "watch" controller using ESP-now protocol to the Pi4 using an ESP32 board plugged into USB serial. The code for the ESP32 board which sends/receives ESP-now is in the Arduino repository.


This wheeled robot is designed to compete in the DPRG (Dallas Personal Robitics Group) indoor RoboColumbus

The competions it will participate in are 6-can, 4-corner and Quick trip.
