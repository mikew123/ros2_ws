# Title
ROS2 workspace files from ROBO24 robot Pi4 SDCard

## Description
My other repositories are required for the complete project:

[Arduino](https://github.com/mikew123/Arduino) - This code repository has code for each of the microcontrollers which connecct using USB serial to ROS2 topics.

[micropython-stuff-jon](https://github.com/mikew123/micropython-stuff-jon) - This code repository is for the "watch" controller using ESP-now protocol to the Pi4 using an ESP32 board plugged into USB serial. The code for the ESP32 board which sends/receives ESP-now is in the Arduino repository.

This wheeled robot is designed to compete in the DPRG (Dallas Personal Robitics Group) indoor RoboColumbus 
https://www.dprg.org/

The competions it will participate in are 6-can, 4-corner and Quick trip.

There are two versions of each competition; Home and DPRG.
Home is a smaller arena to fit in my office space, the DPRG arean is the competition full size design. For example the home 6-can is 7'x7.5' whereas the DPRG size is 7'x10'
